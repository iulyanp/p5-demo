        Creating the release branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this pointâ€”only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch. Once it's ready to ship, the release gets merged into master and tagged with a version number.

        <h3>This is a hotfix..</h3>
        <p>This is the only branch that should fork directly off of master.</p>
